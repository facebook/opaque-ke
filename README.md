##  The OPAQUE key exchange protocol ![Build Status](https://github.com/novifinancial/opaque-ke/workflows/Rust%20CI/badge.svg)

[OPAQUE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/163.pdf) is an asymmetric password-authenticated key exchange protocol. It allows a client to authenticate to a server using a password, without ever having to expose the plaintext password to the server.

This implementation is based on the [Internet Draft for OPAQUE](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque).

Background
----------

Asymmetric Password Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE) protocols are designed to provide password authentication and mutually authenticated key exchange without relying on PKI (except during user/password registration) and without disclosing passwords to servers or other entities other than the client machine.

OPAQUE is a PKI-free aPAKE that is secure against pre-computation attacks and capable of using a secret salt.

Documentation
-------------

The API can be found [here](https://docs.rs/opaque-ke/) along with an example for usage.

Installation
------------

Add the following line to the dependencies of your `Cargo.toml`:

```
opaque-ke = "1.1"
```

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.51** or higher.
